				<h2>Early life</h2>
				<p>
					Lovecraft was born into a well-off family, but his father suffered from mental illness and was institutionalized when Lovecraft was a young child.
				</p>
				<p>
					He displayed a precocious interest in reading and writing from a young age, with a particular fascination for classic literature, science, and astronomy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Due to family financial difficulties after his father's illness and death, Lovecraft's formal education was sporadic, and he largely educated himself through extensive reading.

				<h2>Writing Career</h2>
				<p>
					Lovecraft's writing career began in the early 1900s when he started writing for amateur publications. His early works were mostly poetry.	
				</p>
				<p>
					He gained recognition in the 1920s when his stories, such as "The Call of Cthulhu" and "The Dunwich Horror," started appearing in pulp magazines like Weird Tales.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lovecraft is best known for creating a unique mythos known as the Cthulhu Mythos, which featured ancient, god-like beings that existed beyond human comprehension. These stories often explored themes of cosmic insignificance and existential dread.
				</p>
				<p>
					His writing style was characterized by elaborate and archaic language, as well as a meticulous attention to detail in world-building.
