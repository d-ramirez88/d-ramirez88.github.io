				<h3>Writing Career</h3>
				<p>
					Lovecraft's writing career began in the early 1900s when he started writing for amateur publications. His early works were mostly poetry.	
				</p>

					He gained recognition in the 1920s when his stories, such as "The Call of Cthulhu" and "The Dunwich Horror," started appearing in pulp magazines like Weird Tales.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lovecraft is best known for creating a unique mythos known as the Cthulhu Mythos, which featured ancient, god-like beings that existed beyond human comprehension. These stories often explored themes of cosmic insignificance and existential dread.
