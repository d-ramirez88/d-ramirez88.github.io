				<h3>Early life</h3>
				<p>
					Lovecraft was born in August 20, 1890 into a well-off family, but his father suffered from mental illness and was institutionalized when Lovecraft was a young child.
				</p>
				<p>
					He displayed a precocious interest in reading and writing from a young age, with a particular fascination for classic literature, science, and astronomy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Due to family financial difficulties after his father's illness and death, Lovecraft's formal education was sporadic, and he largely educated himself through extensive reading.

						Lovecraft is best known for creating a unique mythos known as the Cthulhu Mythos, which featured ancient, god-like beings that existed beyond human comprehension. These stories often explored themes of cosmic insignificance and existential dread.

						His writing style was characterized by elaborate and archaic language, as well as a meticulous attention to detail in world-building.
